## Highly realistic human form that moves like an unconscious human 
Lifelike skin representation with internal steel skeleton fully articulated &amp; over molded in silicone with high fidelity anatomically correct joints.
Anthropometrically calibrated mass and center of mass distribution across segments. Height of 5,7 feet and weight of 165 pounds. From prone to supine, to
lateral log roll or position Frank’s segments follow the movement and inertia of a real unconscious person.

## Ready for in situ EMS training
Engineered for in situ EMS training with strengthen internal skeleton for resistance to wear, stress, and abuse, changeable face mask and chest suit and
replacement arms and legs. Easy to maintain and use and can be operated for up to 20 hours continuously in harsh environments.

## Interactive training and learning
Smartphone based application pairs with integrated sensors from the mannequin to provide real time auditory and visual feedback on spinal
precautions, BVM ventilation, intubation, CPR and support debriefing. 

## Spinal precaution effectiveness
Articulated cervical and lumbar spine with motion sensors providing real-time and differed feedback on head and trunk motion during mobilization and
transfer.

## Advanced airway
Weighted head that moves in 4D with articulated jaw to allow airway opening techniques and sniffing position, realistic airways allowing insertion of naso-
tracheal, supraglottic and endotracheal devices and sensors-based performances measures from bag valve mask ventilation.

## CPR
Innovative chest anatomy design allowing realistic compression depth and resistance with automatic detection of depth, release and frequency of compressions according to guidelines.
