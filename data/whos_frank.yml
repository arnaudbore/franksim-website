title: "Who is Frank"
subtitle: "Frank simulates a realistic unconscious human (175 cm / 70 kg) that can be mobilized, intubated, ventilated, resuscitated and transported in EMS scenarios. HeÂ provides higher realism and fidelity then existing mannequins for both in situ simulation and tasks-oriented learning in EMS with a fully articulated skeleton with high anthropometric and biomechanical fidelity that allows it to be seated, suspended, rolled, mobilized during transfers with realism."
