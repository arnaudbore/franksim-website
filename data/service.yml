  - name: "Highly realistic human form that moves like an unconscious human"
    description: >
                Lifelike skin representation with internal steel skeleton fully articulated &amp; over
                molded in silicone with high fidelity anatomically correct joints.
                Anthropometrically calibrated mass and center of mass distribution across
                segments. Height of 5,7 feet and weight of 165 pounds. From prone to supine, to
                lateral log roll or position Frank’s segments follow the movement and inertia of a
                real unconscious person.
